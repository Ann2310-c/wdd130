        <p>Hello! My name is Ana Maria Mosquera, and I am from Popayan, Colombia. I am currently studying Software
            Development
            at BYU Pathway and I enjoy learning more about programming every day. I also love spending time with my
            family. I am
            a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and my faith is an important part of my life.
            My goal
            is to keep improving my skills and work toward a successful career as a software developer.</p>
